TODO
====

-   Improve the compatibility of CHD software Collections when used with 
    a different version of Mame than the collection 
    (embed software list hashs matching the version?)
-   Make support of command line options set by user when querying the rompath
-   Add support for Mame CHD collections
-   Do some pretty basic GUI to ease the use on Windows or by users not 
    confortable with command line
-   Support for auto-completion
-   Handle the configuration parameters (ie rompath and so one) set from
    the command line too.
-   Create simple screencast to demonstrate usage
-   Get asynchronously the length of the download via the zipview 
    (not given by archive.org via HTTP headers)
-   Distribute as a zipped package containing README + CHANGELOG etc. as
    well
-   Use packr to include JVM ?
