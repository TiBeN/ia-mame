-   Improve the compatibility of CHD software Collections when used with 
    a different version of Mame than the collection

-   Do some pretty basic GUI to ease the use on Windows or by users not 
    confortable with command line
-   Support for auto-completion
-   Create simple screencast to demonstrate usage
-   Get asynchronously the length of the download via the zipview 
    (not given by archive.org via HTTP headers)
-   Add support for negative boolean options (-[no]option)
-   Distribute as a zipped package containing README + CHANGELOG etc. as
    well
-   Use packr to include JVM on the executable ?
-   Do more tests with differents version of Mame to be more precise on the
    README about Mame version support.

    MameArguments.getRawOptionsArgs()
