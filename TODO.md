-   Improve the compatibility of CHD software Collections when used with 
    a different version of Mame than the collection 
    (embed software list hashs matching the version?)
-   Do some pretty basic GUI to ease the use on Windows or by users not 
    confortable with command line
-   Support for auto-completion
-   Create simple screencast to demonstrate usage
-   Use packr to include JVM on the executable ?
-   Do more tests with differents version of Mame to be more precise on the
    README about Mame version support.
-   Do support of news command line switchs since Groovymame merged with
    mame
-   BUG: file length for Mame roms is not fetched
-   Check if softwares needing many files case is handled correctly (multi
    CD for example)
-   Add support for 7z compressed files when scanning for rom files on the 
    rompath
